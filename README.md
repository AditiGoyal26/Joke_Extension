# Joke_Extension

The "Joke Extension" is a simple, fun browser extension that fetches and displays random jokes to users. This project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and easy-to-use interface, allowing users to get a quick laugh right from their browser toolbar.

Once the extension is added it can be seen on the top right section of browser, like shown below:

When you click the yellow icon, you can then see a joke generated randomly each time.
A sample output can be seen below:
